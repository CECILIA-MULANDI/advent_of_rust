### Day 1

⚠️ Important Note
We use clone() in this example, but we are not claiming it is the optimal approach. The goal here is to present a solution that helps illustrate Rust's ownership system in a simple way. As the story unfolds in the next challenge, we'll dive into more efficient patterns. This example is intentionally simplified for the sake of education and storytelling.

Enjoy!

### The Story

It's 1st December and the countdown has just begun. The elves are busy preparing for the Christmas and Santa is busy checking the list of children who have been good this year. It was supposed to be a smooth day until all of a sudden two of santa's elves burst into Santa's office with a problem.

“Santa!” one of the elves shouted. “The code won’t compile! We’ve hit a wall, and it’s all Rust’s fault!”

Santa, sipping his triple-shot peppermint latte, raised an eyebrow. “Rust’s fault? Or your fault?”

“It’s the ownership rules!” the other elve blurted. “I think we violated them, we’re used to Python, where variables just... work. Look at this!”

### Your Mission

The elves have tried their best but the code doesn't compile.

You need to find a way to make the code compile without changing the attach_message_to_present function.
